Note: The values cannot be stored in an array if the array is not initialized/rendered into the memory.

Using Meta Character:
--------------------
 Ex:
 let products:string[] = [];   // Initialization 
 products[0] = "TV";
 products[1] = "Mobile";
 console.log(products.toString());
 Ex:
 let products:string[];
 products = [];      //rendering
 products[0] = "TV";
 products[1] = "Mobile";
 console.log(products.toString());

 Using Array Constructor:
-------------------------
 Ex:
 let products:string[] = new Array();
 products[0] = "TV";
 products[1] = "Mobile";
 console.log(products.toString());
 Ex:
 let products:string[];
 products = Array();
 products[0] = "Samsung TV";
 products[1] = "Mobile";
 console.log(products.toString());
* new is dynamic memory allocating operator.

Typescript Array Manipulation Methods
-------------------------------------
1. Returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array.
   let nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
   console.log(nums.slice(1, 4));  // [2, 3, 4]

2. Returns the first element that matches the condition.
   let nums = [10, 20, 30, 40];
   let result = nums.find(n => n > 25);
   console.log(result);  // 30

3. Returns all elements that match the condition.
   let nums = [10, 20, 30, 40];
   let result = nums.filter(n => n > 25);
   console.log(result);  // [30, 40]

4. Transforms every element and returns a new array.
   let nums = [1, 2, 3];
   let result = nums.map(n => n * 2);
   console.log(result);  // [2, 4, 6]

5. Adds one or more elements to the end of the array.
   let fruits = ["apple", "banana"];
   fruits.push("cherry");
   console.log(fruits);  // ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

6. Removes the last element and returns it.
   let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
   let last = fruits.pop();
   console.log(last);    // "cherry"
   console.log(fruits);  // ["apple", "banana"]

7. Removes the first element and returns it.
   let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
   let first = fruits.shift();
   console.log(first);   // "apple"
   console.log(fruits);  // ["banana", "cherry"]

8. Adds one or more elements to the beginning of the array.
   let fruits = ["banana", "cherry"];
   fruits.unshift("apple");
   console.log(fruits);  // ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

9. Executes a reducer function on each element, resulting in a single output value.
   let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
   let sum = numbers.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, 0);
   console.log(sum);  // 15

10.array.splice(startIndex, deleteCount, item1?, item2?, ...)
   startIndex	The index at which to start changing the array
   deleteCount	Number of elements to remove
   item1...     (Optional) Items to insert at startIndex
i. Remove elements
   let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
   let removed = arr.splice(1, 2);  // Remove 2 elements from index 1
   console.log(removed);  // [2, 3]
   console.log(arr);      // [1, 4, 5]
ii.Insert elements
   let arr = [1, 4, 5];
   arr.splice(1, 0, 2, 3);  // Insert 2 and 3 at index 1, delete 0
   console.log(arr);       // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
iii.Replace elements
   let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
   arr.splice(2, 2, 99, 100);  // Remove 2 elements from index 2, add 99, 100
   console.log(arr);  // [1, 2, 99, 100, 5]
iv.Remove all from a point
   let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
   arr.splice(3);  // Removes everything from index 3 onward
   console.log(arr);  // [1, 2, 3]

11.Default Behavior
   Sorts elements as strings in ascending order.
   let arr = [30, 4, 21, 100];
   arr.sort();
   console.log(arr);  // [100, 21, 30, 4] ❌ (wrong for numbers)
i. arr.sort((a, b) => a - b);  // Ascending
   console.log(arr);  // [4, 21, 30, 100]
   arr.sort((a, b) => b - a);  // Descending
   console.log(arr);  // [100, 30, 21, 4]
ii.let fruits = ["banana", "apple", "cherry"];
   fruits.sort();
   console.log(fruits);  // ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

12.let nums = [1, 2, 3];
   nums.reverse();
   console.log(nums);  // [3, 2, 1]
i. let names = ["Zara", "John", "Alex"];
   names.sort().reverse();  // Descending alphabetical
   console.log(names);  // ["Zara", "John", "Alex"]

   const map = new Map<string, number>();
   map.set("one", 1);
   map.set("two", 2);
   for (let key of myMap.keys()) {
   console.log(key);  // "one", "two"
   }
   for (let value of myMap.values()) {
   console.log(value);  // 1, 2
   }
   console.log(map.get("one"));      // 1
   console.log(map.has("two"));      // true
   console.log(map.size);            // 2
   map.delete("one");
   for (let [k, v] of map.entries()) {
   console.log(k, v);
   }

  ====================
1.  What are the differences between == and === operator.
Ans.== checks only value but === checks the value as well as type of the value.
Ex:
   console.log(5 == '5');          // true  
   console.log(null == undefined); // true 
   console.log(0 == false);        // true

Typescript Function Parameters
------------------------------
Note: 
i.  DEFAULT PARAMETER
    function greet(name: string, age: number = 30): void {
    console.log(`Hello ${name}, age ${age}`);
   }
    greet("Bob");  // age = 30
ii. For unlimited parameters of the same type is called as Rest Parameter.
    function sum(...numbers: number[]): number {
    return numbers.reduce((total, n) => total + n, 0);
   }
    console.log(sum(1, 2, 3, 4));  // 10
ii. Function with object parameter is known as destructing.
    function display({ name, age }: { name: string; age: number }) {
    console.log(`${name} is ${age}`);
   }
    display({ name: "Tom", age: 40 });

Typescript Anonymous Function
-----------------------------
i.  Assigned to a Variable
Ex: const add = function(a: number, b: number): number {
    return a + b;
  };
    console.log(add(2, 3)); // 5
OR 
    const multiply = (x: number, y: number): number => x * y;
    console.log(multiply(4, 5)); // 20

ii. Anonymous Function as Callback
Ex: let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
    let squared = numbers.map(function(num: number): number {
    return num * num;
   });
    console.log(squared); // [1, 4, 9, 16]
OR
   let squaredArrow = numbers.map(num => num * num);

Typescript Function Return
--------------------------
i.  Returning an object
    function createUser(name: string, age: number): { name: string; age: number } {
    return { name, age };
   }
ii. Returning arrays
    function getFruits(): string[] {
    return ["apple", "banana"];
   }
iii.Return array function
    const square = (x: number): number => x * x;

Typescript Function Closure
---------------------------
* A closure is a function that remembers the variables of outer scope wven though the outer function completes its execution, it means the inner function can access outer function variables even if i call it later.
Ex: function Outer(out:string){
    return function Inner(in:string){
     console.log(`${out} : ${in}`);
   }};
   let val = Outer('Hello');
   val('World'); // Hello : World
Ex: function createCounter() {
   let count = 0;
   return function () {
    count++;
    return count;
  };
 }
   const counter = createCounter();
   console.log(counter()); // 1
   console.log(counter()); // 2
   console.log(counter()); // 3
*  Closure is used for data encapsulation and maintaining state in callbacks.

Typescript Function Recursion
-----------------------------
Ex: function factorial(n:number):number{
    if(n==0)return 1;           // The condition that stops the recursion.
    return n * factorial(n-1);  // Where the function calls itself.
   }
    console.log(factorial(5)); // Output: 120
Ex: function fibonacci(n:number):number{
    if(n<=1)return n;           // The condition that stops the recursion.
    return fibonacci(n-1) + factorial(n-2);  // Where the function calls itself.
   }
    console.log(fibonacci(6)); // Output: 8

  constructor() {
    Demo.s = Demo.s + 1;  // increment shared static variable
    this.n = this.n + 1;  // increment instance variable (starts at 0)
  }

  Print() {
    console.log(`s=${Demo.s} n=${this.n}`);
  }
}
OP: s=1 n=1

**ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS FOR INTERVIEW**
  ==================================
1.  Can you use TypeScript with existing JavaScript code?
Ans: Yes, in tsconfig.json file we need to write "allowJs": true inside compilerOptions object.

2.  Explain readonly vs const in TypeScript?
Ans: const can be applied only on variables where as readonly only applies on objects, classes, interfaces.
*    const prevents reassignment of variable where as readonly prevents the modification of variable.

3.  What’s the difference between any, unknown, void, and never?
Ans: "any" refers any type i.e it temporarly disable type checking.
     "unknown" requires type checking before using the value.
     "void" means the function does not return anything.
     "never" means the function never returns anything, it is needed at the time of error checking.

4.  What is the difference between optional and readonly property.
Ans: optional refers property may or may not be present in an object where as property cannot be changed after the object is created.

5.  What is keyof, typeof, and in in TypeScript?
Ans: The keyof operator is used to get a union type of all the keys of an object type.
Ex:
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}
type PersonKeys = keyof Person;  // "name" | "age"

*  The typeof operator is used to get the type of a value or a variable.
Ex:
const person = {
  name: 'Alice',
  age: 30,
};
type PersonType = typeof person;  // { name: string, age: number }

* type Person = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};
type HasName = 'name' in Person;  // true
type HasEmail = 'email' in Person;  // false

6.  What is intersection types.
Ans: In TypeScript, intersection types allow you to combine multiple types into one.
UseCase: You want to add additional properties or behaviors to existing types.
         You want to combine multiple types or interfaces into one.
Ex: Combining  two types
type A = { name: string };
type B = { age: number };
type Person = A & B;
const person: Person = { name: 'Alice', age: 30 };  // valid

Ex: Combining Interface
interface Employee {
  name: string;
  role: string;
}
interface Contact {
  phone: string;
  email: string;
}
type EmployeeWithContact = Employee & Contact;
const employee: EmployeeWithContact = {
  name: 'Bob',
  role: 'Developer',
  phone: '123-456-7890',
  email: 'bob@example.com',
};

7.  What is type keyword in typescript.
Ans: The type keyword is used to define custom types or type aliases.
Ex: 
type Name = string;
type Age = number;
const name: Name = 'Alice'; // 'Alice' is of type string
const age: Age = 30;        // 30 is of type number

Ex: 
type Person = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};
const person: Person = {
  name: 'Bob',
  age: 25
};

Ex:
type Status = 'success' | 'error' | 'pending';
const status: Status = 'success'; // valid
